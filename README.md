# snippet-posw

Stateless Proof-of-Work (PoW) gate for Cloudflare **Snippets / Workers**.

This project provides a self-contained L7 “front firewall” that:

- Exposes a PoW API under `/{POW_API_PREFIX}/*` (default: `/__pow/*`).
- Gates matched requests: if the client does not have a valid `__Host-pow_sol` cookie, it serves an HTML challenge page (navigation) or returns `403 { code: "pow_required" }` (non-navigation).
- Stays **stateless** on the server side (no KV/DO/DB): everything is derived/verified with HMAC and short-lived cookies.

## Files

- `pow.js`: source snippet (PoW API + PoW gate).
- `template.html`: minimal challenge page template injected into the build.
- `build.mjs`: build script (esbuild + HTML minify) → `dist/pow_snippet.js`.
- `dist/pow_snippet.js`: ready-to-paste Cloudflare Snippet output.

## Configuration

Edit `CONFIG` in `pow.js` to match your host/path patterns and enable PoW:

```js
const CONFIG = [
  { pattern: "example.com/**", config: { POW_TOKEN: "replace-me", powcheck: true } },
];
```

Notes:

- `POW_TOKEN` is required when `powcheck: true` (this snippet does not fall back to any other secret).
- `pattern` matching is first-match-wins; put more specific rules first.
- This snippet is intentionally **business-agnostic**: it does not rewrite paths and does not implement `?sign=` validation.

### bindPath (for proxy-style endpoints)

If you have an endpoint whose *effective* target path is carried in a parameter/header (e.g. `/info?path=/some/object`), you can bind PoW to that target path **without** changing rule matching or difficulty selection:

- `bindPathMode: "query"` + `bindPathQueryName`
- `bindPathMode: "header"` + `bindPathHeaderName` (+ optional `stripBindPathHeader: true`)

When enabled, missing/invalid bindPath input returns `400`.

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Output: `dist/pow_snippet.js` (checks the Cloudflare Snippet 32KB limit).

## Deploy

1. Build and copy `dist/pow_snippet.js` into Cloudflare **Snippets** (or deploy as a Worker).
2. Ensure it runs **before** any downstream auth/business snippets (if you use multiple snippets).
3. Keep `/__pow/*` reachable from browsers during the challenge flow.
