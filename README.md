# snippet-posw

Stateless PoW / Turnstile gate for Cloudflare **Snippets / Workers**.

This project provides a self-contained L7 front gate that:

- Exposes a PoW API under `/{POW_API_PREFIX}/*` (default: `/__pow/*`).
- Supports **PoW-only**, **Turnstile-only**, or **combined** mode.
- Issues a single proof cookie (`__Host-proof`) on success.
- Stays **stateless** on the server side (no KV/DO/DB): all checks are derived/verified with HMAC and short-lived cookies.

## Files

- `pow.js`: source snippet (PoW API + gate).
- `glue.js`: browser-side UI + orchestration (loaded by the challenge page).
- `esm/esm.js`: browser-side PoW solver (`computePoswCommit`).
- `template.html`: minimal challenge page template injected into the build.
- `build.mjs`: build script (esbuild + HTML minify) → `dist/pow_snippet.js`.
- `dist/pow_snippet.js`: ready-to-paste Cloudflare Snippet output.

## Configuration

Edit `CONFIG` in `pow.js` to match your host/path patterns and enable **PoW** and/or **Turnstile**:

```js
const CONFIG = [
  { pattern: "example.com/**", config: { POW_TOKEN: "replace-me", powcheck: true } },
];
```

Notes:

- `POW_TOKEN` is required when `powcheck` or `turncheck` is `true`.
- When `turncheck: true`, you must also set:
  - `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY`
  - `TURNSTILE_SECRET`
- `pattern` matching is first-match-wins; put more specific rules first.

## Config Reference

Each `CONFIG` entry looks like:

```js
{ pattern: "example.com/**", config: { /* keys below */ } }
```

### `pattern` syntax

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | `string` | Host pattern with optional path glob: `host` or `host/path`. Host `*` matches a single label fragment (does not cross `.`). Path supports `*` (no `/`) and `**` (may include `/`); a trailing `/**` also matches the base path (e.g. `/foo/**` matches `/foo` and `/foo/...`). |

### `config` keys (all supported)

## Proof Cookie (`__Host-proof`)

The gate issues a single proof cookie with a mode mask:

- Format: `v1.{ticketB64}.{iat}.{last}.{n}.{m}.{mac}`
- `m` mask:
  - `1` = PoW
  - `2` = Turnstile
  - `3` = PoW + Turnstile

A request is allowed when `(m & requiredMask) == requiredMask`.
When `ATOMIC_CONSUME` is enabled, the proof cookie is still accepted if present, but new validations happen on the business path using atomic tokens (no new `__Host-proof` is issued).

## Internal bypass

You can bypass the gate for internal traffic by matching a specific query param or header. When a match occurs, the snippet returns `fetch(request)` and skips PoW/Turnstile checks. This is useful for internal APIs because Snippet rules cannot match on headers or query strings. You can also strip the bypass credential before proxying.

Configuration (exact match required):

- Query param: `INNER_AUTH_QUERY_NAME` + `INNER_AUTH_QUERY_VALUE`
- Header: `INNER_AUTH_HEADER_NAME` + `INNER_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE`

Example:

```js
{ pattern: "example.com/**", config: {
  POW_TOKEN: "replace-me",
  powcheck: true,
  INNER_AUTH_QUERY_NAME: "auth",
  INNER_AUTH_QUERY_VALUE: "my-internal-token",
  INNER_AUTH_HEADER_NAME: "X-Inner-Auth",
  INNER_AUTH_HEADER_VALUE: "X-Inner-Auth-Value",
  stripInnerAuthQuery: true,
  stripInnerAuthHeader: true,
} }
```

Notes:

- Both name and value must be set for a match.
- If both query and header are configured, **both must match** to bypass.
- If only one is configured, that single match is sufficient.
- The bypass only applies to protected paths (non-`/__pow/*` requests).
- If `stripInnerAuthQuery`/`stripInnerAuthHeader` are `true`, the matched credential is removed before proxying.

## Turnstile integration

- Turnstile renders with `cData = ticket.mac`.

Default (`ATOMIC_CONSUME=false`):

- **Turn-only** (`powcheck=false, turncheck=true`): client calls `POST /__pow/turn` → server `siteverify` → `__Host-proof (m=2)`.
- **Combined** (`powcheck=true, turncheck=true`): `/__pow/turn` is disabled (404); `siteverify` happens only in the final `POST /__pow/open`.

Atomic consume (`ATOMIC_CONSUME=true`):

- **Turn-only**: `/__pow/turn` is disabled (404). Client attaches `turnToken + ticket` to the business request and the snippet verifies + forwards the original request.
- **Combined**: `/__pow/open` returns `{ done: true, consume: "v2..." }` and does **not** set `__Host-proof`. Client attaches `turnToken + consume` to the business request; the snippet verifies consume (HMAC + tb), binding, then `siteverify`.
- **Transport**: cookie > header > query (header preferred over query when both present). Navigation tries a short-lived cookie first (Max-Age 5s, Path = target), then falls back to query; embedded flows use `postMessage` for header replay. Tokens are stripped when `STRIP_ATOMIC_QUERY/STRIP_ATOMIC_HEADERS` are `true`. The cookie is cleared after use.

### Early-bind (combined mode)

In combined mode, PoW is bound to the Turnstile token:

- `tb = base64url(sha256(turnstile_token).slice(0, 12))`
- PoW seed uses `bindingString + "|" + tb`.
- `__Host-pow_commit` (v4) carries `tb` and the final `/open` verifies `turnToken → tb`.

This guarantees **one token → one PoW**, preventing “1 PoW + N tokens”.

### `tb` design (Turnstile binding tag)

`tb` is a compact binding tag derived from the Turnstile token:

- `tb = base64url(sha256(turnstile_token).slice(0, 12))` (96-bit tag, 16 chars base64url).
- Used to bind PoW/consume tokens to a specific Turnstile token without carrying the full token.
- Stored inside signed artifacts: `__Host-pow_commit` (v4) and `consume` (v2).
- Recomputed on the server from `turnToken` and compared (`tb` must match).
- For non-Turnstile flows, `tb = "any"`.

`tb` is not secret; integrity is enforced by HMAC on the enclosing token/cookie.

## CCR: Commit → Challenge → Open

PoW uses a stateless CCR API:

1. **Commit**: the browser computes the PoSW commitment (`rootB64 + nonce`) and calls `POST /__pow/commit`.
   - The snippet verifies the ticket binding and mints a short-lived `__Host-pow_commit` cookie.
   - In combined mode, `/commit` must include `token` (Turnstile token) to bind `tb`.
2. **Challenge**: the browser calls `POST /__pow/challenge`.
   - The snippet uses deterministic RNG derived from the commit to generate sampled `indices`, `segLen`, optional `spinePos`, and a batch `token`.
3. **Open**: the browser calls `POST /__pow/open` with `opens` for the sampled indices.
   - The snippet verifies and advances the cursor; repeats until done, then issues `__Host-proof` (non-atomic).
   - In combined mode, the final `/open` must include `turnToken` and triggers `siteverify` (non-atomic).
   - In atomic combined mode, the final `/open` returns `consume` and `siteverify` moves to the business path.

Key properties:

- **No server-side session**: all state is either recomputed or carried in signed cookie/token.
- **Strict serial progression (RTT-lock)**: each `/open` depends on the previous cursor/token, so clients cannot parallelize or reorder batches.

## Sliding renewal (proof cookie)

When enabled, the gate can renew `__Host-proof` on navigation requests:

- `PROOF_RENEW_ENABLE: true`
- `PROOF_RENEW_MAX`: max renewal count
- `PROOF_RENEW_WINDOW_SEC`: only renew near expiry
- `PROOF_RENEW_MIN_SEC`: minimum seconds between renewals

The renewal re-issues a fresh ticket + proof with the same mask `m`, and is capped by a hard max lifetime.

## Root-bound Hashcash (`POW_HASHCASH_BITS`)

This is **not** a standard Hashcash stamp format. It is a lightweight, *commitment-bound* extra PoW condition:

- It is only checked when the sampled index is the **last step** (`i = L`).
- The server computes:
  - `digest = SHA256("hashcash|v3|" || merkleRoot || chain[L])`
  - and requires `leadingZeroBits(digest) >= POW_HASHCASH_BITS`.

Why it exists:

- It provides an **exponential cost knob** with minimal server overhead (one SHA-256 and a leading-zero count).
- Because it is bound to `merkleRoot` and `chain[L]`, it cannot be “pre-stamped” independently of the actual PoSW chain commitment.
- Increasing `POW_HASHCASH_BITS` increases the expected client work by roughly `~ 2^bits`, because the client must retry with a different nonce (which changes the whole chain commitment) until the condition holds.

## PoSW + Merkle: why sampling works

- The browser builds a strictly sequential hash chain of length `L` (“PoSW chain”).
- It commits to the full chain with a Merkle root (`rootB64`).
- For each sampled index `i`, the browser reveals:
  - `hPrev = chain[i - segLen]` with its Merkle proof
  - `hCurr = chain[i]` with its Merkle proof
  - optional midpoint `hMid` proof for extra constraints (`spinePos`)
- The snippet verifies:
  - **in-segment sequential derivation** (`hPrev` → … → `hCurr` in exactly `segLen` steps)
  - **Merkle membership proofs** for revealed chain values

This makes “skipping work”, “sparse computation”, or “fabricating opens” a losing bet: the attacker must hope sampled segments never cover their “bad steps / bad intervals”.

## RTT-lock and throughput ceiling

With default parameters:

- Total sampled indices: `S = 2 + POW_SAMPLE_K * POW_CHAL_ROUNDS = 182`
- `POW_OPEN_BATCH = 15` ⇒ number of `/open` calls: `m = ceil(S / 15) = 13`
- Total serial PoW API requests: `M_api = 1(/commit) + 1(/challenge) + m(/open) = 15`

So a single IP’s token minting throughput is bounded by:

- `tokens/s ≤ 1 / (M_api * RTT)`

This limit comes from network latency (physics), not local compute.

## “Exchange rate” with Cloudflare WAF Rate Limit

A practical ops pattern is to put a WAF Rate Limit (e.g. `50 req / 10s / per IP`) in front of both `/__pow/*` and protected paths.

Since minting one proof consumes at least `M_api = 15` serial requests:

- `1 proof ≈ 15 rate-limit units`
- Under `50/10s/IP`, each IP can mint at most `floor(50/15) = 3` tokens per 10 seconds (in the ideal case)

This effectively turns Cloudflare’s rate limiter into a *stateful* quota counter, while the snippet remains stateless.

## Parallelization and “chain break” economics

PoSW itself is not a magical “anti-parallel” primitive. Attackers may try to split the chain at some breakpoint and compute segments in parallel, gambling that samples never cross the breakpoint.

This implementation reduces the expected value of such attacks by:

- verifying *contiguous segments* (`(i - segLen, i]`) — any sample crossing the breakpoint fails immediately
- using deterministic, more evenly-covered sampling to reduce “lucky gaps”

## Operational tuning tips

- Prefer adjusting `POW_DIFFICULTY_COEFF` and/or lowering `POW_OPEN_BATCH` (stronger RTT-lock) instead of blindly increasing `POW_SAMPLE_K`/`POW_CHAL_ROUNDS`.
- Keep a WAF/RL budget that includes both `/__pow/*` and protected endpoints so token minting “spends” budget at a predictable rate.

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Output: `dist/pow_snippet.js` (checks the Cloudflare Snippet 32KB limit).

## Deploy

1. Build and copy `dist/pow_snippet.js` into Cloudflare **Snippets** (or deploy as a Worker).
2. Ensure it runs **before** any downstream auth/business snippets (if you use multiple snippets).
3. Keep `/__pow/*` reachable from browsers during the challenge flow.

## Managed Challenge (optional)

If you enable Turnstile with `cData` binding, Managed Challenge often adds little value and is usually unnecessary. Prefer tuning PoW/Turnstile + WAF Rate Limit; keep Managed Challenge only if you want an extra, independent hurdle.
